# 30 Day Github Challenge - Learn Java
## Created by: Jeffrey Miller
##Part 1 - Java Essential Training
The first part of my 30 day github challenge will be to complete an Java training course provide by [www.lynda.com] entitled "Java Essential Training". I will be committing the lessons I complete nightly.
##Part 2 - Let's build a full stack App!
The second part of my 30 day github challenge is to build a full stack application that uses Java where applicable. Seeing as I am a newb to this language, I cannot
speak to any more depth than that. Check back by the end of next week (6/23) for more descriptive details.
